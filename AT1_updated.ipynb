        "  The most elegant paper with great detail seemed to be the first one by Shannon, it spoke about the process of communication via a network, on a fundamental level in binary sequence. It stated the challenges of different communcation scenarios and how to overcome them. But for this assigment, I wanted to review a paper which is more in lines with the practical applications of data sciecnce that I may encounter during/after the masters. So I choose a few papers [2-4] that were related to Deep Learning and Image recognition, as i was interested in knowing more about these topics.\n",
        "  \n",
        " While the Eigenfaces vs Fisherfaces seemed a good paper, it seemed to be talking about facial recognition techniques only and I was looking for a more geenralised concept. Finally paper 3 and 4 seemed to be the on the lines of the current state deep learning solutions. After doing a quick scan and browsing these concepts it seemed that GAN is more advanced concept than Neural Networks and going through some image recognition videos like the one below from Stanford, I realised that CNN in 2012 was a break-through moment in Image recogonition and so I dedcided to read more about that.\n",
